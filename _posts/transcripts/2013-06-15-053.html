	<p>This is The Web Ahead, a conversation about changing technologies and the future of the Web. I’m your host Jen Simmons, and this is episode 53! I want to first say thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Environments for Humans, with their 2013 CSS Summit which seems to be kind of awesome! We’ll talk about that later in the show.</p>

	<p>And I just want to say hello! So many of you have tweeted at me or sent emails through the <a href="http://5by5.tv">5by5 website</a> or <a href="http://jensimmons.com">my own website</a> and said like, “Where are you? Where’s the show?” [laughs] It’s been a little while. This has happened before. I don’t really mean for it to happen. It’s just all of a sudden, I don’t know, five weeks have gone by and I haven’t done a show. The show‘s not dead! I’m totally doing this show! I just, I think mostly this spring it’s been— I’ve been, I just went, I just did four conferences — presentations plus an all-day workshops. So, I don’t know, weeks go by. But, here we are, and I’m working on booking more shows in the future into I think the end of June we’re going to do one and then a bunch in July and August, and definitely the show’s around. If you’re a new-ish, newer listener and you’ve not listened to all 52 previous episodes, do that if you want more Web Ahead. They don’t really go out of date, really. There’s one thing and one show that I think is now a little out of date, but everything else is totally current. So, for those of you that have listened to all 50, now 53— 52.1 episodes, sorry. We’ll be back, I promise.</p>

	<p>So today! Today, we’re going to talk about <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr> animations, transforms, transitions. You can use CSS to make things move around on the page, something that we used to kind of do with JavaScript and then we sort of didn’t. And then we did it with Flash and now we’re not using Flash. But you can totally do a lot of that same stuff. You’re even better in CSS. So, today I have Val Head joining us. Hi Val!</p>
</dd>

<dt>Val Head</dt>
<dd>Hi guys! Hey Jen! Saying hi to the chatroom first, sorry. [laughs]</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yes, hello everyone. Oh! And for those of you who don’t know, you can listen to the show live. If you go to <a href="http://5by5.tv/schedule">5by5.tv/schedule</a>, you can see the schedule of all of the shows that 5by5 broadcasts live and everytime I have a new episode of The Web Ahead booked, it gets put on that calendar, and you can look and see when the next episode is. And if it’s in a time zone when you’re awake, you can totally listen by going to <a href="http://5by5.tv/live">5by5.tv/live</a> and listen live. There’s also a chatroom you can get into, <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> freenode channel 5by5 or use the web interface on the live webpage. There’s, right there, just get into the chatroom. Yeah. Kind of fun. Kind of cool. It’s fun having people, like right now, there’s people listening right now. And we know it.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>That’s amazing! I see them</dd>

<!-- 3:20 -->

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>They can totally harass us and they can correct what we’re saying.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>[laughs]</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>It’s nice! We can’t see them, but we know they’re there. [laughs]</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>We can see them in the chat. I guess that’s sort of seeing them. But yeah, not exactly. [laughs]</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>So, you’re a web designer, yeah? And you’re…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yes!</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>…you‘re a consultant.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I do basically, mostly freelance web design. Design things, work with various teams and small agencies to kind of, you know, work together. Make awesome web stuff. So that’s pretty fun. And then I also teach a lot of workshops. I teach workshops on CSS animations and also teaching designers how to program. So, those are both really, really fun things to do.</dd>

<!-- 3:58 -->

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Nice. And we finally met in person when— It was <a href="http://rustbeltrefresh.com">Rustbelt Refresh</a>.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yeah! Which seems like it was just yesterday but I think it was like two months ago. [laughs]</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>It seems like it was a million years ago. [laugh]</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>No, that was a fun time. It was like…</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>…first time in Cleveland in a very long time and it was a fun, fun conference.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yeah. They did a good job putting it together.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>So let’s talk about animations. So, what’s the deal? You wrote this book for Five Simple Steps, this little pocket guide book which we can talk about more…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yeah!</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>…as we go. But, there’s transforms,…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>…there’s transitions, and there’s what is officially called animation…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>…because it uses the word <code>animation</code> in the property of CSS. I mean, also I tend to use the word animation to just mean animation. Like anything moving. But—</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Well, that is what it means, right? Like the technical definition or just like the dictionary definition of animation is giving something movement, right?</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Giving it breath, is what it actually means. [laughs]</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yeah, yeah. I think that’s the literal one. And so it’s like— I like to call it transitive formations because I think the terms are just so confusing. You know both transitions and animations can make things move, so technically they are both animating. And transforms technically don’t cause any movement but, gosh that name sounds like it should! So, your transforms— And then transforms are the things you might transition or animate. So, it gets really confusing.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yeah, you confused me already.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>So— Well, transforms basically just change the way something appears and we can do that in 2D or 3D. We can skew it, rotate it, scale it, do all sorts of crazy just horrible things to whatever [laughs] the image or <code>div</code> is. We can kind of stack those on top of each other, right? Like if you have a transform, you can translate something on one axis, you can scale it, and you can also skew it and just do all this stuff. But that will only affect the way it looks. It won’t cause any change of state. Like, you’ll just see it instantly be skewed or instantly be rotated. So transforms just change the appearance. Transitions—</dd>

<!-- 6:04 -->

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>So, let’s just back up a second.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>So transform— If, let’s say you have a box,…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>…then your transform could make your box be rotated five degrees.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yeah, it could make it like literally rotated. It could make it like a funky parallelogram. You know, skew it a little to one side.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>What are the other— Let’s go through— Let’s go through what the things are that transforms can do, then we’ll, like, we’ll talk about the other ones.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Oh man, I wish I had the list in front of me because there’s a bunch. But you can rotate, and you can rotate along— You can just rotate, sorry, like just that’s it or you can rotate along any of the three — you know, x, y, or z axises— Axes, rather. Oh goodness, that was a great sentence. So you can translate along any of those, or rotate on any of those.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>So you can— You can rotate,…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>…you can skew,…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm. You can scale. Or you can translate.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>…or you can scale, right? So that’s one where, like you could have— I mean, this is something that I’ve found interesting because if I have a word…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>…and it’s in 20<abbr title="point">pt</abbr> font, right? Pixel, sorry. There’s no points on the Web…</dd>

<dt>Both</dt>
<dd>[laugh]</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>A 20<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr> font. And I say I want this to be— Is it 50% or is it 50, I forget, the scale—</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Scale is out of 1 technically.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Oh.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>So if you wanted 50%, you would make it…</dd>

<dt>Both</dt>
<dd>.5</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Right, so I could say, “Okay, I’ve got 20pt and I’m going to make it scale to .5 so now it’s 10pt font. Or I could say I want it to scale to 2…”</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>“…so now it’s a 40pt font. Or I could alternatively make my font be 10pt,…”</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>“…-pixels, or 40px or 20px or—” You know? So it’s like this other way—</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Like, <code>transform: scale;</code> is like a different way to make anything on the page be bigger or smaller than it would have been already.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm.</dd>

<!-- 7:58 -->

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yep. And then, you know, translate’s kind of the same where that moves it around and it’s, you know, it just does the same thing where it just changes its position, very similar to what changing what its <code>left</code> and <code>top</code> properties would be, but it’s translating instead. So—</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd><code>transform: translate</code>, right?</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm. Yeah, <code>transform: translate</code>. Because as if transform wasn’t confusing enough,…</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>[laughs]</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>…<code>transform: translate</code>—</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Let’s toss another T-word in there.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>[laughs]</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>So—</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Were they just really liking the consonants or something? I don’t know.</dd>

<!-- 8:26 -->

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>So <code>transform: translate</code> means, “Hey, when you calculate where this goes on the page, I want you to put it where you thought you were going to except— No, wait a minute! I want you to…”</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yeah, move it over a little bit. [laughs]</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>“…count, do some math from that place where it would have been, and I want you instead to move it this far on the x-axis or this far on the y-axis or <code>translate3d</code> would be…”</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>“…in 3D space too.” Right? So you could—</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yes!</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>And that’s a good way— I mean, it’s interesting with CSS layouts. CSS layouts are already hard enough, but now suddenly you could jigger something, place it somewhere else on the page by using <code>transform: translate</code>…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>…and say, “I just need you to move it over from where you thought it was going to be.”</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>And now that— And like you said before, it’s not an animation property. This is just a do-what-I-tell-you-now property?</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yeah! Exactly. I mean, we can animate it, and we can transition it, but technically on its own it doesn’t do any of that. Though it does come in handy in the sense that, kind of like what you were just saying, if you were laying out a page, you’re never going to do that with <code>transform: translate</code>, right?</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>The whole page.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>That just feels weird?</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>That would be crazy.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>So, if you stick to— When you’re animating and transitioning, if you use that <code>transform: translate</code> to move things around, you’ve kind of created a nice separation where you know your animations won’t mess with your layout, hopefully. Or there’s less chance of it. I suppose you could still make a mess, but it helps separate things and keep it a little more straight in your brain.</dd>

<!-- 9:50 -->

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>So you might want have wanted to use <code>transform: translate</code>, you do your regular layout to do sort of the inital state…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>…and then you use <code>transform: translate</code> to mark where something will end up,…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yeah, I do that a lot.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>…and then you animate it, you animate it across from where it started to where it ends up.</dd>

<!-- 10:05 -->

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yeah, and then you know that you’re, you know, if you’re animating or transitioning this <code>transform: translate</code> — as tongue-twister as it is — if you’re animating those transforms, you’re safe to know that you’re not going to mess up your layout or mess something up that maybe someone else was working on, so…</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Right.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>It does come in handy in that sense despite the incredibly confusing names. [laughs]</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>It’s really— That’s why I was working on a project about the time we were both at Rustbelt…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>…Rustbelt Refresh, that was heavily with animation. And I kind of got my brain into it, but it’s been now a month since I was done with that, and now I’m like all over again— It just, it feels like all of the things we’re going to talk about today are— It’s a new part of CSS, and a lot of the new parts of CSS are fairly— are easy, honestly, for those of us who know CSS really well and have written CSS for years. So the adding the ability to do <code>box-shadow</code> or adding the ability to do <code>border-radius</code> didn’t feel that hard. You know? It felt like, “Oh, I got to look it up, and then I got to re-look it up the first 15 times I use it.”</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yeah, it’s not a big step.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>But now I got it memorized. I’ve used it 15 times. I have it memorized. This stuff was like, “Oh! That’s what it felt like to not know CSS…”</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>[laughs]</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>“That’s what life was like back in 2000-whatever when I was learning this for the first time.” Like, “Ohhhh, crap! [laughs] This is harder than I— Woah. This stuff is challenging.”</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Well, it’s a whole different way of thinking, right? I mean, before we could do— Before we could make things move with CSS — for lack of a better way to lump them together — we were kind of styling pages almost as if we were doing print, right? Like you were making things— You were marking up a document, styling it up, making it look pretty. But it was always still more-or-less static…</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>…in that sense. There was no, like, time to it. There was no depth in that dimension. So no when we make things— When you have the ability to make things move, suddenly it’s less of a document and more of an almost, like, a stage depending on how far you want to take it.</dd>

<!-- 12:06 -->

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>And you kind of end up with these pieces of your site almost being more like characters and, you know, having more life to them than just like be blue, have rounded corners, and have a drop shadow. Now you’re like, “Be blue, have a drop shadow, and over two seconds rotate like this,” or something. It’s just— It’s a very different way of thinking about things.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>So it’s not really— It’s not the CSS we’re used to, but it’s pretty cool!</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>It’s also a whole— I mean, we’ve already been talking out in the wider web design community it seems everyone today is talking about new techniques for accomplishing web design,…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>…and new tools, adding new tools to our toolbox. Because Photoshop alone or still photographs of one kind or another, still drawings of final products don’t convey this motion or movement.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Like you can’t— I mean, unless you want to do storyboards the way the films do, or keyframe and draw out the keyframes that you want the way that someone would storyboard a film or a cartoon, but…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>People definitely do that even for, you know, website things or animated web things.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>It’s a lot more work. I mean, it’s also designing in code. This is where you can just…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>[laughs]</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>…design in the code, play and play and play until you get what you want even if it’s not production code, even if what you’re doing is coming up with ideas that you’re going to pass off to a development team.</dd>

<!-- 13:26 -->

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Oh yeah! Especially if you’re doing something that has to react to, like, user input. It’s really— I mean, you can draw that out as many times as you want, but you’re not going to know if it works until you try to make it and try to use it, right?</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Like, until you try to interact with it, you’ve got no idea if that motion is a good motion to have. So—</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Well, it’s like when I used to design lighting for theater,…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>…you would plan the whole thing out and perhaps even do some 3D modelling of it, which didn’t exist when I was doing it [both laugh] theater design, but it does for people today. But you had no idea. I mean, you would draw a map of where all the lights were going and all the colors you wanted to use, but you had to actually get in the theater and run the cues and say, “I think this— I want this to be a five second transition.” And then you realize that, “No, that should really be three seconds,” or, “No, that should really be eight seconds,” or “No, that should really be 10 seconds.” And you would literally get all of the actors and all of the technicians and everybody who was involved might also be moving pieces of set and people setting of pyrotechnics and people doing music, playing music live, or people— And you would run the cue with lighting and all of the other things. And you’d start a couple, you know, sentences before the cue and then you run a sentance or two after the cue, and you’d be like, “Okay! Looks good to me!” And the other designers, each who had their own department, would be like, “No, I need to—” “No, that looks good to me,” or “No, let’s do that again.” And you like run the cue three, four, or five times and see whether or not it worked. Because there’s no way to know until you get there.</dd>

	<p>This is The Web Ahead, a conversation about changing technologies and the future of the Web. I’m your host Jen Simmons, and this is episode 53! I want to first say thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Environments for Humans, with their 2013 CSS Summit which seems to be kind of awesome! We’ll talk about that later in the show.</p>

	<p>And I just want to say hello! So many of you have tweeted at me or sent emails through the <a href="http://5by5.tv">5by5 website</a> or <a href="http://jensimmons.com">my own website</a> and said like, “Where are you? Where’s the show?” [laughs] It’s been a little while. This has happened before. I don’t really mean for it to happen. It’s just all of a sudden, I don’t know, five weeks have gone by and I haven’t done a show. The show‘s not dead! I’m totally doing this show! I just, I think mostly this spring it’s been— I’ve been, I just went, I just did four conferences — presentations plus an all-day workshops. So, I don’t know, weeks go by. But, here we are, and I’m working on booking more shows in the future into I think the end of June we’re going to do one and then a bunch in July and August, and definitely the show’s around. If you’re a new-ish, newer listener and you’ve not listened to all 52 previous episodes, do that if you want more Web Ahead. They don’t really go out of date, really. There’s one thing and one show that I think is now a little out of date, but everything else is totally current. So, for those of you that have listened to all 50, now 53— 52.1 episodes, sorry. We’ll be back, I promise.</p>

	<p>So today! Today, we’re going to talk about <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr> animations, transforms, transitions. You can use CSS to make things move around on the page, something that we used to kind of do with JavaScript and then we sort of didn’t. And then we did it with Flash and now we’re not using Flash. But you can totally do a lot of that same stuff. You’re even better in CSS. So, today I have Val Head joining us. Hi Val!</p>

<dt>Val Head</dt>
<dd>Hi guys! Hey Jen! Saying hi to the chatroom first, sorry. [laughs]</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yes, hello everyone. Oh! And for those of you who don’t know, you can listen to the show live. If you go to <a href="http://5by5.tv/schedule">5by5.tv/schedule</a>, you can see the schedule of all of the shows that 5by5 broadcasts live and everytime I have a new episode of The Web Ahead booked, it gets put on that calendar, and you can look and see when the next episode is. And if it’s in a time zone when you’re awake, you can totally listen by going to <a href="http://5by5.tv/live">5by5.tv/live</a> and listen live. There’s also a chatroom you can get into, <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> freenode channel 5by5 or use the web interface on the live webpage. There’s, right there, just get into the chatroom. Yeah. Kind of fun. Kind of cool. It’s fun having people, like right now, there’s people listening right now. And we know it.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>That’s amazing! I see them</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>They can totally harass us and they can correct what we’re saying.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>[laughs]</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>It’s nice! We can’t see them, but we know they’re there. [laughs]</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>We can see them in the chat. I guess that’s sort of seeing them. But yeah, not exactly. [laughs]</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>So, you’re a web designer, yeah? And you’re…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yes!</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>

<dt>Val</dt>

	<p>This is The Web Ahead, a conversation about changing technologies and the future of the Web. I’m your host Jen Simmons, and this is episode 53! I want to first say thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Environments for Humans, with their 2013 CSS Summit which seems to be kind of awesome! We’ll talk about that later in the show.</p>

	<p>And I just want to say hello! So many of you have tweeted at me or sent emails through the <a href="http://5by5.tv">5by5 website</a> or <a href="http://jensimmons.com">my own website</a> and said like, “Where are you? Where’s the show?” [laughs] It’s been a little while. This has happened before. I don’t really mean for it to happen. It’s just all of a sudden, I don’t know, five weeks have gone by and I haven’t done a show. The show‘s not dead! I’m totally doing this show! I just, I think mostly this spring it’s been— I’ve been, I just went, I just did four conferences — presentations plus an all-day workshops. So, I don’t know, weeks go by. But, here we are, and I’m working on booking more shows in the future into I think the end of June we’re going to do one and then a bunch in July and August, and definitely the show’s around. If you’re a new-ish, newer listener and you’ve not listened to all 52 previous episodes, do that if you want more Web Ahead. They don’t really go out of date, really. There’s one thing and one show that I think is now a little out of date, but everything else is totally current. So, for those of you that have listened to all 50, now 53— 52.1 episodes, sorry. We’ll be back, I promise.</p>

	<p>So today! Today, we’re going to talk about <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr> animations, transforms, transitions. You can use CSS to make things move around on the page, something that we used to kind of do with JavaScript and then we sort of didn’t. And then we did it with Flash and now we’re not using Flash. But you can totally do a lot of that same stuff. You’re even better in CSS. So, today I have Val Head joining us. Hi Val!</p>

<dt>Val Head</dt>
<dd>Hi guys! Hey Jen! Saying hi to the chatroom first, sorry. [laughs]</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yes, hello everyone. Oh! And for those of you who don’t know, you can listen to the show live. If you go to <a href="http://5by5.tv/schedule">5by5.tv/schedule</a>, you can see the schedule of all of the shows that 5by5 broadcasts live and everytime I have a new episode of The Web Ahead booked, it gets put on that calendar, and you can look and see when the next episode is. And if it’s in a time zone when you’re awake, you can totally listen by going to <a href="http://5by5.tv/live">5by5.tv/live</a> and listen live. There’s also a chatroom you can get into, <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> freenode channel 5by5 or use the web interface on the live webpage. There’s, right there, just get into the chatroom. Yeah. Kind of fun. Kind of cool. It’s fun having people, like right now, there’s people listening right now. And we know it.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>That’s amazing! I see them</dd>

<!-- 3:20 -->

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>They can totally harass us and they can correct what we’re saying.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>[laughs]</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>It’s nice! We can’t see them, but we know they’re there. [laughs]</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>We can see them in the chat. I guess that’s sort of seeing them. But yeah, not exactly. [laughs]</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>So, you’re a web designer, yeah? And you’re…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yes!</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>…you‘re a consultant.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I do basically, mostly freelance web design. Design things, work with various teams and small agencies to kind of, you know, work together. Make awesome web stuff. So that’s pretty fun. And then I also teach a lot of workshops. I teach workshops on CSS animations and also teaching designers how to program. So, those are both really, really fun things to do.</dd>

<!-- 3:58 -->

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Nice. And we finally met in person when— It was <a href="http://rustbeltrefresh.com">Rustbelt Refresh</a>.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yeah! Which seems like it was just yesterday but I think it was like two months ago. [laughs]</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>It seems like it was a million years ago. [laugh]</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>No, that was a fun time. It was like…</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>…first time in Cleveland in a very long time and it was a fun, fun conference.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yeah. They did a good job putting it together.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>So let’s talk about animations. So, what’s the deal? You wrote this book for Five Simple Steps, this little pocket guide book which we can talk about more…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yeah!</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>…as we go. But, there’s transforms,…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>…there’s transitions, and there’s what is officially called animation…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>…because it uses the word <code>animation</code> in the property of CSS. I mean, also I tend to use the word animation to just mean animation. Like anything moving. But—</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Well, that is what it means, right? Like the technical definition or just like the dictionary definition of animation is giving something movement, right?</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Giving it breath, is what it actually means. [laughs]</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yeah, yeah. I think that’s the literal one. And so it’s like— I like to call it transitive formations because I think the terms are just so confusing. You know both transitions and animations can make things move, so technically they are both animating. And transforms technically don’t cause any movement but, gosh that name sounds like it should! So, your transforms— And then transforms are the things you might transition or animate. So, it gets really confusing.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yeah, you confused me already.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>So— Well, transforms basically just change the way something appears and we can do that in 2D or 3D. We can skew it, rotate it, scale it, do all sorts of crazy just horrible things to whatever [laughs] the image or <code>div</code> is. We can kind of stack those on top of each other, right? Like if you have a transform, you can translate something on one axis, you can scale it, and you can also skew it and just do all this stuff. But that will only affect the way it looks. It won’t cause any change of state. Like, you’ll just see it instantly be skewed or instantly be rotated. So transforms just change the appearance. Transitions—</dd>

<!-- 6:04 -->

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>So, let’s just back up a second.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>So transform— If, let’s say you have a box,…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>…then your transform could make your box be rotated five degrees.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yeah, it could make it like literally rotated. It could make it like a funky parallelogram. You know, skew it a little to one side.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>What are the other— Let’s go through— Let’s go through what the things are that transforms can do, then we’ll, like, we’ll talk about the other ones.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Oh man, I wish I had the list in front of me because there’s a bunch. But you can rotate, and you can rotate along— You can just rotate, sorry, like just that’s it or you can rotate along any of the three — you know, x, y, or z axises— Axes, rather. Oh goodness, that was a great sentence. So you can translate along any of those, or rotate on any of those.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>So you can— You can rotate,…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>…you can skew,…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm. You can scale. Or you can translate.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>…or you can scale, right? So that’s one where, like you could have— I mean, this is something that I’ve found interesting because if I have a word…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>…and it’s in 20<abbr title="point">pt</abbr> font, right? Pixel, sorry. There’s no points on the Web…</dd>

<dt>Both</dt>
<dd>[laugh]</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>A 20<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr> font. And I say I want this to be— Is it 50% or is it 50, I forget, the scale—</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Scale is out of 1 technically.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Oh.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>So if you wanted 50%, you would make it…</dd>

<dt>Both</dt>
<dd>.5</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Right, so I could say, “Okay, I’ve got 20pt and I’m going to make it scale to .5 so now it’s 10pt font. Or I could say I want it to scale to 2…”</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>“…so now it’s a 40pt font. Or I could alternatively make my font be 10pt,…”</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>“…-pixels, or 40px or 20px or—” You know? So it’s like this other way—</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Like, <code>transform: scale;</code> is like a different way to make anything on the page be bigger or smaller than it would have been already.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm.</dd>

<!-- 7:58 -->

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yep. And then, you know, translate’s kind of the same where that moves it around and it’s, you know, it just does the same thing where it just changes its position, very similar to what changing what its <code>left</code> and <code>top</code> properties would be, but it’s translating instead. So—</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd><code>transform: translate</code>, right?</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm. Yeah, <code>transform: translate</code>. Because as if transform wasn’t confusing enough,…</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>[laughs]</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>…<code>transform: translate</code>—</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>Let’s toss another T-word in there.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>[laughs]</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>So—</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Were they just really liking the consonants or something? I don’t know.</dd>

<!-- 8:26 -->

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>So <code>transform: translate</code> means, “Hey, when you calculate where this goes on the page, I want you to put it where you thought you were going to except— No, wait a minute! I want you to…”</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yeah, move it over a little bit. [laughs]</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>“…count, do some math from that place where it would have been, and I want you instead to move it this far on the x-axis or this far on the y-axis or <code>translate3d</code> would be…”</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>“…in 3D space too.” Right? So you could—</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yes!</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>And that’s a good way— I mean, it’s interesting with CSS layouts. CSS layouts are already hard enough, but now suddenly you could jigger something, place it somewhere else on the page by using <code>transform: translate</code>…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>…and say, “I just need you to move it over from where you thought it was going to be.”</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yeah.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>And now that— And like you said before, it’s not an animation property. This is just a do-what-I-tell-you-now property?</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yeah! Exactly. I mean, we can animate it, and we can transition it, but technically on its own it doesn’t do any of that. Though it does come in handy in the sense that, kind of like what you were just saying, if you were laying out a page, you’re never going to do that with <code>transform: translate</code>, right?</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>The whole page.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>That just feels weird?</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>That would be crazy.</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>So, if you stick to— When you’re animating and transitioning, if you use that <code>transform: translate</code> to move things around, you’ve kind of created a nice separation where you know your animations won’t mess with your layout, hopefully. Or there’s less chance of it. I suppose you could still make a mess, but it helps separate things and keep it a little more straight in your brain.</dd>

<!-- 9:50 -->

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>So you might want have wanted to use <code>transform: translate</code>, you do your regular layout to do sort of the inital state…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Mmm-hmm.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>…and then you use <code>transform: translate</code> to mark where something will end up,…</dd>

<dt>Val</dt>
<dd>Yeah, I do that a lot.</dd>

<dt>Jen</dt>
<dd>…and then you animate it, you animate it across from where it started to where it ends up.</dd>

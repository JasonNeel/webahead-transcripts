Transcripts of The Web Ahead
====================

This is the beginning of a place to hold transcripts of The Web Ahead. 

The Web Ahead is a radio show about changing technologies and the future of the web, discussing HTML5, mobile, responsive design, evolving content strategies, internet history, and much more. You can listen to the show by [subscribing on iTunes](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=464936442&partnerId=30&siteID=GfpxbBXXpXE-y3gfJGyOQcSr2tOpkzD12A) or going to the [5by5.tv website](http://5by5.tv/webahead). 

##How You Can Help
I just had some people offer to help out with this project, asking what they could do. So I thought I'd make a list.

1. Find anything that should be a link, and make it a link.
2. Find anyplace that says "inaudible" with a time stamp, go listen to the show, and see if you can understand what was being said.
3. Correction any mistakes you find.
4. Transcribe new episodes! Summit new transcriptions while still in progress, so other people know you are working on one. It's ok if you don't get all the way through a show. Just do part, and then collaborate by sending a pull request and let others help finish it.

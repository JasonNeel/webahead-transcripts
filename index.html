    <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
    <p>I just had some people offer to help out with this project, asking what they could do. So I thought I'd make a list.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Find anything that should be a link, and make it a link.</li>
    <li>Find anyplace that says "inaudible" with a time stamp, go listen to the show, and see if you can understand what was being said.</li>
    <li>Correction any mistakes you find. (Still waiting to see if someone notices that mistake.)</li>
    <li>Transcribe new episodes! <a href="http://github.com/jensimmons/webahead-transcripts/issues">Open an issue on GitHub</a>, so other people know you are working on an episode and we don't have two people working on the same one. Feel free to summit parts of new transcriptions while still in progress. It's ok if you don't get all the way through a show. Just do part, and then collaborate by sending a pull request and let others help finish it.</li>
    </ol>

     <p>To do these tasks, you need a free <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> account. First, you <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">fork</a> the <a href="https://github.com/jensimmons/webahead-transcripts">repo for this site</a>, so you have your own personal copy. Then you can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git">make changes</a> to your copy. And submit those changes back to the official version as a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">pull request</a>.</p>

<h2>What's Going to Happen to These Transcripts?</h2>
<p>Well, to start with, people can read them here. This summer, I plan to start creating a proper/bigger website for The Web Ahead, with a place for each transcript to live with the show itself. Stockpiling a bunch of transcripts is a great place to start on the new site.</p>

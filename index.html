    <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
    <p>I just had some people offer to help out with this project, asking what they could do. So I thought I'd make a list.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Find anything that should be a link, and make it a link.</li>
    <li>Find anyplace that says "inaudible" with a time stamp, go listen to the show, and see if you can understand what was being said.</li>
    <li>Correction any mistakes you find.</li>
    <li>Transcribe new episodes! Summit new transcriptions while still in progress, so other people know you are working on one. It's ok if you don't get all the way through a show. Just do part, and then collaborate by sending a pull request and let others help finish it.</li>
    </ol>
    
     <p>To do these tasks, you need a free <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> account. First, you <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">fork</a> the <a href="https://github.com/jensimmons/webahead-transcripts">repo for this site</a>, so you have your own personal copy. Then you can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git">make changes</a> to your copy. And submit those changes back to the official version as a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">pull request</a>.</p>
